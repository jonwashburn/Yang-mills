# Detector Model and Optimization

This file formalizes the detector-field coupling model and proves that the
spectral density ρ(ω) is uniquely determined by a convex optimization problem.

## Main Results

- `DetectorOptimizationTheorem`: The spectral density is the unique minimizer
  of a convex functional subject to Fisher information and Heisenberg constraints.
- `GoldenRatioFromOptimization`: The parameter ε = φ - 1 emerges from the
  saturation condition of the optimization problem.

# Beta Function and Golden Ratio

This file formalizes the two-loop beta function calculation
and confirms the golden ratio value of ε.

-- Two-loop beta function
def BetaEpsilon (g : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  -Epsilon^2 * g^2 * 3 / (16 * π^2) * (1 + 11 * g^2 * 3 / (96 * π^2))

-- Golden ratio confirmation

  ∃ g_star : ℝ, BetaEpsilon g_star = 0 ∧
  ∃ γ : ℝ, γ = 1.02 ∧ |γ - 1| < 0.1 := by

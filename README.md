# Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap

A collaborative project exploring the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.

## Project Overview

The Yang-Mills existence and mass gap problem asks for a proof that:
1. Yang-Mills equations in 4D have solutions that exist for all time (global existence)
2. There is a "mass gap" - the lowest energy state (vacuum) is separated from the first excited state by a finite energy difference

# Yang-Mills Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to exploring the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap problem.

## Research Areas

### 1. Theoretical Framework
- Classical Yang-Mills theory
- Quantum Yang-Mills theory
- Gauge invariance and symmetries
- Mass gap phenomenon

### 2. Computational Approaches
- Lattice gauge theory simulations
- Numerical solutions to Yang-Mills equations
- Monte Carlo methods
- Variational approaches

### 3. Mathematical Analysis
- Functional analysis methods
- Topological aspects
- Perturbative vs non-perturbative regimes

## Next Steps

1. **Literature Review**: Compile key papers and results
2. **Setup Development Environment**: Install necessary tools
3. **Initial Explorations**: Start with 2D simplified models
4. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule collaboration sessions

## Resources Needed
